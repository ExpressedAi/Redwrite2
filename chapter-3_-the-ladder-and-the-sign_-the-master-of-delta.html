      <p>He had replaced the string with a pair of small speakers and a microphone wired back into itself. "Governance," he said, as if introducing a villain. He turned the knob and the room bloomed with a low, pleasant hum, then a soft howl, then a banshee shriek that made the porcelain on the shelf disagree with being alive.</p>

      <p>I flinched. He clicked something invisible and the scream died to a well-behaved purr, like a cat remembering who pays rent.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Same gain," he said. "Different sign. Positive hands the system a megaphone and tells it secrets. Negative tells it to sit down and try again. You don't get stability by pep talk."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He slid a narrow board onto the table and chalked two smooth waves across it that crossed and crossed again. Where they met he pressed harder until the chalk bit the wood. "X marks the spot," he said. "Buried treasure lives at crossings."</p>

      <p>He tapped the X with the chalk's wooden end. "See X, you all?" He let the pun hang long enough to be unforgivable. "Ten," he added, drawing the Roman stroke cleanly. "Count carries consequence."</p>

      <p>He pulled a tuning fork from his coat, struck it, and set it on the table; the bowl's water stitched with ripples. He struck a second fork a hair low. The beating between them swelled the room into a slow ache you could lean against.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Preference is not structure," he said. "You can love this ache. You can make records from it and sell them to people in black. That doesn't change what it is. Near-ratios make roughness. Roughness is an error signal in a nervous system that evolved to like closure because closure kept it not-dead."</p>
      </div>

      <p>"So horror music is…" I began.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"A curated rash," he said. "Enjoy it. Don't call it home."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He took a piece of thread, stretched it over the board, and pinned it at a half, a third, a quarter. Each segment found its own clean truth under his finger. "Two to one," he said, "octave. Three to two, fifth. Four to three, fourth. The little integers don't argue; they nod."</p>

      <p>He plucked them again in order—C, E, G in the air without the names—and my chest arranged itself around the sound like furniture finally where it belonged.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Stack the thirds," he said. "C-E-G. E-G-B. G-B-D. B-D-F. D-F-A. F-A-C. Loop closed." He didn't look up. "Order isn't an opinion. It's arithmetic wearing a crown it didn't ask for."</p>
      </div>

      <p>"You keep saying 'hierarchy' like it's a compliment," I said.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"It's a description," he said. "Lower-order factors organize higher-order composites. Two and three are bossier than eleven. This is not elitism, it's job assignment."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He drew a tiny dot on the board, then a single vertical stroke beside it. "Wave and particle," he said. The dot sat there like a seed. The line stood like a staff. "The squiggle is the one, the stroke through air. The sealed bead is the zero, the perfectly contained. You'll be tempted to worship them separately because it lets you feel like you get a mystery for free. They're the same story told under different tests."</p>

      <p>He erased the dot with the side of his palm, left a smudge, then drew the dot again inside a circle, then rubbed out the circle so the dot looked both lonelier and more itself.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"You want 'meaning'," he said, "like there's a store that sells it bespoke. 'Meaning' is the mean in you: the average of your measures when your ratios fit. When your crosses cross well, you get that little clarity-bell in the chest and write poetry about it."</p>
      </div>

      <p>"That's… corny," I said.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"It's accurate," he said. "Which is better than clever on days you need the floor to hold."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He dragged the chalk back through the two waves until the crossings stood out like intersections on a town map. "Add a negative here," he said, marking one, "and watch the beat go thin." He did something with the speakers again and the throbbing envelope folded inward to a thread you could almost not hear unless you leaned into it with your breath.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"You like cancellation too much," he said without looking. "It flatters the part of you that wants the ledger balanced at zero. Fit isn't annihilation. It's conversation with good timing."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He wrote nothing for a while. He looked at my hand, not my face. "Draw me a scale," he said finally.</p>

      <p>"I don't—"</p>

      <p>"You do."</p>

      <p>I drew a ladder of seven rungs, then added the eighth where the first had been, because I couldn't not. He nodded once, as if the chalk had said something witty.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Now walk it with your throat," he said.</p>
      </div>

      <p>I felt ridiculous and obedient. I sang the steps in a thin, steady line, no vibrato, like I was reading a meter and wanted to impress it with my handwriting.</p>

      <p>"Again," he said. "Listen for the closures, not your pride." I sang again. The fourth felt safe; the fifth felt like a hand held out and taken; the seventh begged to resolve or be forgiven.</p>

      <p>"Good," he said, too cool to hand out a ribbon twice in one day. "Now, ladder backward." I did. The seventh cried less on the way down. It had been reassured that the ground existed.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"You hear that?" he said. "That's the scale showing you its ethics. Place tension; resolve it. Keep a beating budget. Don't export cost downstream and call it genius."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">He pointed to the speakers again. "Sign governs whether you stabilize or shriek. Same room, same gear, different sign, different life. Ratios build the ladder; signs decide whether you're climbing or falling."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He killed the loop and the room remembered itself. He pressed his thumb to the spot on the board where the X had been and left a clean oval in the chalk dust, the way a fingertip leaves a witness on a glass.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"'Meaning'," he said, almost gentle now, "is just your measures agreeing about what fits. Stop waiting for thunderbolts. Start listening for averages."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He set the chalk down flat so it wouldn't roll. "We're done," he said, which in his mouth always felt like a kindness because he never wasted the word.</p>

      <p>At the door, his hand found my shoulder for the length of one beat. "You're quick with crossings," he said. "Make sure you're not cheating by living only where lines meet. There's the measure; there's the rest. Learn both or don't pretend you're making music."</p>

      <p>He let go. I did the housekeeping without being told: squared the chair, wiped the board in a single diagonal, coiled the thread. The tick in the corner resumed its polite insistence.</p>

      <p class="mt-8 italic text-gray-600">Later, trying to name the lesson, I failed and settled for a sequence: first the ache of near-miss, then the clean click of a ratio that holds, then the quiet knowledge that direction isn't a feeling but a sign you choose on purpose.</p>
