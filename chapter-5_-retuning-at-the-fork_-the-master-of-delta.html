      <p>He had rearranged the room into a problem.</p>

      <p>On the table: three cards facedown, a brass bell, a cheap kitchen timer with a cracked lens, and a bowl full of folded slips. The metronome ticked at a sprinter's pace, like someone trying not to be late for their own life.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Agency," he said, as if announcing a weather front. "You keep arguing it's magic. It's knobs."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He set the timer to one minute and hit the plunger. The red flag slid up and began to fall. "When the bell rings," he said, tapping the cards, "you will flip one and do what it says. Everything else you want to tell me about freedom can wait until you're done doing the thing."</p>

      <p>He waited until half the minute was gone. "Flip."</p>

      <p>I flipped the first card.</p>

      <p class="font-mono text-base bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded border-l-4 border-purple-500">BREATHE 4 / 6. RETUNE. THEN… PICK THE RIGHT BOWL.</p>

      <p>"Pick the right bowl?" I said, eyeing two identical bowls he'd set near the edge—one empty, one with a scrap of paper taped under it where I couldn't see.</p>

      <p>"Tick," he said, looking at the timer, and I hated him happily.</p>

      <p>I inhaled to a count of four, exhaled to six. The room widened the way it always did when you gave it permission. I put my hand over the left bowl, felt nothing, moved to the right, felt the faintest stupid thread of conviction, and lifted. Tape. A paper circle. Drawn on it in pencil: a small X like the memory of a crossing.</p>

      <p>The bell rang. He didn't so much as blink, which counts as applause in his language.</p>

      <p>"Again," he said, resetting the timer. "This time I'll give you the fork without the breath. We'll see if you want to be free or merely surprised."</p>

      <p>The red flag fell. I flipped a card.</p>

      <p class="font-mono text-base bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded border-l-4 border-purple-500">POINT TO OUTSIDE.</p>

      <p>I pointed toward the door.</p>

      <p>"Room," he said. "Again."</p>

      <p>"The world beyond the—"</p>

      <p>"Your mouth," he said. His finger flicked the metronome to a new tempo mid-tick; the room stumbled.</p>

      <p>"Again."</p>

      <p>I pointed at him.</p>

      <p>"Terrible taste," he said. "Again."</p>

      <p>The timer's bell bit the air. He nodded at the bowl I hadn't chosen. He lifted it, showed me the taped paper beneath: a circle without an X. "Forks present the same scene," he said. "You want freedom to mean 'I could have done otherwise' while remaining otherwise. Freedom means you can retune and then do otherwise. Retuning is not a feeling; it's settings."</p>

      <p>He pushed the bowl of folded slips toward me. "Pressure," he said. I unfolded one.</p>

      <p class="font-mono text-base bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded border-l-4 border-purple-500">OPEN LOOP: RETURN MASTER'S BOOK.</p>

      <p>I frowned. He watched it happen the way a hawk watches a vole think about its life choices.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Open loops are carried differences," he said. "Unclosed accounts that shape the next pass. You will swear they don't. That's because you don't keep a ledger. We will now."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He dropped three more slips into the bowl, each stamped OPEN. "We'll resolve one per minute until the bowl is empty. Pick."</p>

      <p>I picked. RETURN MASTER'S BOOK stared back like a witness that had better places to be. The timer laughed at me. I turned to the shelf. There were eight identical notebooks.</p>

      <p>"Which is mine?" he asked, innocence weaponized.</p>

      <p>"They all look the same," I said.</p>

      <p>"Correct," he said. "And?" He adjusted the metronome again, a hair faster. My chest tightened to match.</p>

      <p>I picked one. Wrong. He let me feel it land wrong. I breathed. Four in, six out. My eyes did the work my pride didn't want to do—looked for the one he always put back a hair to the left of the stack, the one slightly warped from having been closed on a mechanical pencil too often. I returned that one.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">He let his mouth almost warm. "Skill," he said, "is fast retune with low exported noise. Anyone can thrash. You will not bill the world for your latency and call it art."</p>
      </div>

      <p>The bowl had more slips. OPEN LOOP: CLEAN BOARD. OPEN LOOP: RESET TEMPO. OPEN LOOP: DRINK WATER. I started clearing debt. The room changed tone. He let it, then broke it.</p>

      <p>"Shock," he said.</p>

      <p>He lifted one metronome off its stand and dropped it two tempos faster; the two ticks began to sneer at each other. He shut off the overhead light; the window admitted a flatter gray. He moved one chair leg a half-inch out of square. Petty vandalism. The breath in me wanted to match the mess.</p>

      <p>"Retune," he said.</p>

      <p>I exhaled long. The ticks at war became two lines on paper I'd learned to read. I slid the metronomes onto a common plank; their kicks persuaded each other out of their sulk. The bell rang.</p>

      <p>"Good girl," he said, absentminded, and then denied me the ribbon. "Again."</p>

      <p>He handed me two identical pages of text. "You will read both passages and choose a course of action," he said. "Same observation. Different histories."</p>

      <p>One page was annotated in my own tidy hand (I did not ask how he had pulled that off); a margin note circled a phrase, don't rush; ask Sophia first. The other page was clean. The instruction at the bottom of both pages was the same: PUBLISH BY NOON.</p>

      <p>"Pick," he said.</p>

      <p>"I should ask Sophia," I said, unable not to, gesturing at the annotated page.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"History shapes policy," he said. "Good. Not reflex. Not randomness. Memory. That's agency: you can use what's been true before to choose now without needing a special sky with permissions. If a different memory would have led to a different action, then stop whining. You could have done otherwise; you had to be otherwise."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He pointed at the metronome. "Shock," he said again, with gratuitous pleasure. He knocked it off the plank. It wobbled, ticked stupidly, and threatened to stall. I caught it. He watched my hand catch it with an interest that had nothing to do with wood and springs.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Phase plan," he said. "You'll need one. Who or what do you sync with on purpose? When? How tightly? Take out a pen."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He pulled a card from his pocket and drew three columns without labels, because of course he would refuse me the kindness of categories. He wrote a few words anyway, small and rude: breath, morning light, Sophia, ship slots, no midnight heroics. He slid the card to me.</p>

      <p>"Write your own," he said. "If you leave it implicit, you will call your thrash 'mystery' and confuse your friends."</p>

      <p>I wrote. He watched my choices like he'd put them there the day I was born.</p>

      <p>He placed a small mirror on the table, the barber's kind again. "Now we test," he said. "I'll ask you to switch tempo while telling me the story of yesterday. I'll change the light; I'll scrape the chair; I'll ask a question that aches. You will hold your plan and retune without exporting cost. If you can't, we'll make the knobs larger. If you still can't, we'll reduce the load. Either way, we won't lie to ourselves about what happened."</p>

      <p>He scraped the chair. He dimmed the light. He changed the metronome mid-sentence. "Yesterday?" he said.</p>

      <p>I told him. I left out the parts that would make him proud and included the parts that were honest. When he nudged the tempo, I stretched my vowels a hair longer to match the room without sounding like a fool. When he dimmed the light, I kept my voice bright on purpose. When he asked the aching question—"Why didn't you call?"—I breathed out for six and answered without drama: "Because I wanted a miracle and didn't schedule a plan."</p>

      <p>He let that sit on my tongue like a coin I wasn't sure I deserved to keep.</p>

      <p>"Better," he said. "You don't need thunderbolts. You need levers."</p>

      <p>He tipped the bowl of OPEN slips, now almost empty, and a single folded square clung to the porcelain like a barnacle. I unfolded it.</p>

      <p class="font-mono text-base bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded border-l-4 border-purple-500">OPEN LOOP: SAY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.</p>

      <p>I looked at him.</p>

      <p>"Out loud," he said. "Not for me. For the room."</p>

      <p>"I'm trying," I said, and the metronome slowed on its own, the liar, "to stop making other people pay for my drift."</p>

      <p>He nodded as if I'd finally located the front door in a house that had been generous enough to draw me a map.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Randomness isn't freedom," he said. "It's noise with good press. Freedom is phase control: change your coupling without breaking the song. If you need a trick to remember it at home: hum a note, then shift the oven timer while you're humming and keep the note steady. Or stand up and sit down at a new tempo without turning into a parade. Or breathe four and six while reading your worst email out loud until the email stops owning your breath."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He went kind at the edges, which is to say he let his cruelty be smaller than usual. "Also," he said, "have resets. Short ones you trust. A breath, a glass of water, a walk to the window and back. Call them what you like. Use them on purpose. Then commit."</p>

      <p>He pulled the kitchen timer close and slapped the plunger with two fingers. The red flag fell. We watched it all the way down, which felt like superstition until he called it something else and made it law.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"When the bell rings," he said, "you'll choose a card, retune, and do what it says. Not think about doing it. Not plan to do it later. Do it. That's the only way the room believes you."</p>
      </div>

      <p>The bell rang. I flipped a card.</p>

      <p class="font-mono text-base bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded border-l-4 border-purple-500">CLOSE THE DOOR.</p>

      <p>I closed the door, counted four in, six out, and opened it again without asking permission.</p>

      <p>He didn't smile. He did a thing with his eyes I have learned to want more than his approval: he registered continuity.</p>

      <p>"At last," he said, almost bored. "You're less interesting when you thrash."</p>

      <p>He walked me to the threshold. His hand found my shoulder for the length of one beat.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"You tune fast when you remember you can," he said. "Make remembering easier."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He let go. I squared the chair, wiped the board, stacked the notebooks with the bent one slightly left of true. The tick resumed its polite insistence.</p>

      <p class="mt-8 italic text-gray-600">Later, trying to name the lesson, I failed and settled for a sequence: first the hurry, then the fork, then the quiet fact that the levers lived in my hands the whole time—freedom not as a thunderclap but as a retune that the room could hear.</p>
