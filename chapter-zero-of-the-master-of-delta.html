        <p>The door sealed with its usual, smug little kiss. The metronome in the corner ticked like a patient woodpecker. The window—square of pale—minded its business.</p>

        <p>"You don't begin with one," he said, already sweeping the table with his palm as if truth were a spill. "Begin with what holds. What do you see?"</p>

        <p>"Nothing," I said.</p>

        <p>"Lazy," he said. "Say what you see."</p>

        <p>"Grain. A ring where a cup sat too long. Light. A place to put something."</p>

        <p>"Good. Affordance. Invitation. 'Nothing' is the most hardworking employee in the room; you just don't pay it."</p>

        <div class="quote-highlight quote-highlight-philosophy">
          <p class="text-indigo-900 font-semibold text-xl mb-2">"Nothing is the most hardworking employee in the room; you just don't pay it."</p>
        </div>

        <p>He dragged out a ledger with a green cloth spine. Every zero had been punched out with a knife until the columns were a lace of neat holes. "Balance last month."</p>

        <p>I tried. The numbers bucked where the zeros should have steadied them. He watched with the bored relish of a man who knew exactly when I'd fall off and preferred to let gravity handle it.</p>

        <p>"You're drowning in a saucer," he said, not unkindly. "Pull the placeholder and you don't get purity. You get slapstick."</p>

        <p>A plain white bowl appeared. He poured water to the brim until the meniscus dared the room. One tap and a drop fled down the porcelain like a guilty thought.</p>

        <p>"Zero isn't denial," he said. "It's the room. The margin that makes a word possible. The bowl that turns 'wet' into 'soup' instead of a crime scene."</p>

        <div class="quote-highlight quote-highlight-philosophy">
          <p class="text-indigo-900 font-semibold text-xl mb-2">"Zero isn't denial. It's the room. The margin that makes a word possible."</p>
        </div>

        <p>He stilled the metronome with two fingers. The ache where the click should have landed rose like a held breath.</p>

        <p>"The rest performs," he said. "Silence is time's punctuation. No marked gap, no cadence. No cadence, no count. No count, no meaning. 'Nothing' is grammar, not a ghost. Try to eat a paragraph without spaces and see how that treats you."</p>

        <p>"Inhale," he said, eyes on my throat. "Longer out than in."</p>

        <p>I obeyed. I matched his count more than his breath, but the room softened all the same.</p>

        <p>"Good girl," he said, offhand, as if handing a dog a ribbon. Somehow it still burned.</p>

        <p>A small jar appeared: one white marble against glass. Another followed, packed tight with identical marbles.</p>

        <p>"Which has one?"</p>

        <p>"The first."</p>

        <p>"Why?"</p>

        <p>"Because I can see it."</p>

        <p>"No." Clean as a blade. "Because there is room. The space that is not marble makes this marble legible. In the stuffed jar, 'one' is everywhere and nowhere—no edge, no count. Call it perfection and you've reinvented non-being with better PR. A crown needs the hole where the head goes. A letter needs paper. A joke needs timing. This is not controversial."</p>

        <div class="quote-highlight quote-highlight-poetry">
          <p class="text-purple-900 font-semibold text-xl mb-2">"A crown needs the hole where the head goes. A letter needs paper. A joke needs timing."</p>
        </div>

        <p>"Isn't this just wordplay?" I said. "'Nothing' obviously means a lack."</p>

        <p>"Exactly. Lack-of-what, lack-for-what. Relation, not syrup. Ontic modesty—try it on, it fits everyone."</p>

        <p>"Vacuum?"</p>

        <p>"Geometry, fields, fluctuations. A very busy 'nothing.'"</p>

        <p>"Silence?"</p>

        <p>"Noise floor in costume. Also scored rest. Musicians pay for it on purpose."</p>

        <p>"Absolute zero."</p>

        <p>"A rumor with good math. Even ground states twitch."</p>

        <p>He reached for my wrist as if to take my pulse and found instead a steadiness that made him narrow his eyes. Whatever hypothesis that sparked, he filed it without comment. He is careful with hypotheses the way surgeons are careful with fingers.</p>

        <p>"You think this makes life small," he said. "It doesn't. It makes it honest. If you can't love the bowl, you can't be trusted with the soup. If you can't count the spaces, don't write poetry. If you can't hear the rest, don't pretend to keep time."</p>

        <div class="quote-highlight quote-highlight-philosophy">
          <p class="text-indigo-900 font-semibold text-xl mb-2">"If you can't love the bowl, you can't be trusted with the soup. If you can't count the spaces, don't write poetry."</p>
        </div>

        <p>He tapped the metronome back into motion. Tick. Tick. The arm cut light, then light again, sewing.</p>

        <p>"When you lose this," he said, walking me to the door, "clear a surface. Listen for the ache where the click should fall. Put zeros back in your counts. Breathe longer out than in. The big rhythm gathers the little ones."</p>

        <p>He rested a hand on my shoulder for the length of one beat and let go. I straightened the chair, wiped ghost-chalk from the board, and left the door ajar so the tick could leak into the hall like a lighthouse with manners.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 italic mt-12">Later, trying to name the feeling, I failed and settled for a sequence: first the sting, then the steadiness, then the odd relief of being held by something that wasn't a hand. Margins before pictures. Grammar before song.</p>
