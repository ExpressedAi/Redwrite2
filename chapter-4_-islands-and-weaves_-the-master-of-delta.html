      <p>He made me clap with him, which I resented on principle.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Two," he said, marking the table with his finger like a conductor who had lost his orchestra but not his pride. "You clap every other beat. I'll clap every third." He started before I agreed. Our palms landed together, then not, then together again. At six we met as if a door had swung open on schedule.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Islands," he said. "LCM is a ferry schedule. Two and three close at six. You can live there."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He swapped counts. "You keep two; I'll take five." The room filled with off-steps and almosts; at ten we arrived back on the same plank as if nothing bad had ever happened. I tried not to grin. He saw it, of course.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Don't smile at math," he said, amused. "It's unbecoming unless it's earned."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He set two metronomes to neighboring tempos and let them talk. Their ticks slid past each other, slow drift, long patience, a shy weave. I waited for the neat arrival. It didn't come, not within the window of my good manners. The ache didn't resolve so much as stretch thin until my chest learned to stop asking.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Incommensurate," he said. "Two rhythms that won't sign the same lease. You can wait a long time for a ring that never shows. If you're generous, you call it texture. If you're stubborn, you call it wrong."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He took up the little speaker again and laid a bass pulse under a bright tone, then rolled one under the other like he was kneading bread. The high note didn't grow louder so much as breathe—waaa, waa—shape on top of shape.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Cross-frequency coupling," he said, too pleased with his own mouth. "A slow rhythm telling a fast one how big to be. Structure from conversation. Lovers whispering schedules."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He brought the monochord back and ran a lazy three-note arpeggio up the string. It was a ladder at first, polite steps, the mind counting and nodding. Then he sped it. The steps blurred into a color you could hear, a standing hue with a subtle flutter riding its skin.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Time turned sideways," he said, indulgent. "Sequence becomes timbre when you go quick enough. Same notes, different life."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He saw me loving it and decided to hurt me. "Don't get proud," he said. "Anyone can be charmed by a magic trick. Learn what it's for."</p>

      <p>He had me do the claps again—two against three—until the return at six felt like drinking water. He switched me to three against four—twelve; then three against five—fifteen, which was too long for my patience to hold its posture without fidgeting.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Memory gates meaning," he said. "If the composite exceeds your window, it turns to noise. Expand the window and the same signal blooms into pattern. Don't blame the world for your small buckets."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He turned snide just long enough to make it land. "Also, stop calling boredom 'mystery.' Sometimes you just can't count that high yet."</p>

      <p>He drew circles on the board and threaded lines through them like strings on a loom. "Hierarchy arises because simple ratios make short returns. You can build on them. Put your fast loops where the slow ones can carry them; it's how hearts teach lungs not to be fools."</p>

      <p>He pointed to the metronomes, still drifting. "You can work near a ratio without marrying it," he said. He nudged one tempo closer to the other. The aching envelope became lush—near miss with a promise. "This is where novelty lives: rational approximants. Five to four, nine to eight. Dress rehearsal for agreement. You're allowed to flirt."</p>

      <p>I tried to nudge the tempo myself and overshot; the beats collapsed into uniform lock, clean and—for a second—dead.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Don't iron the world flat," he said. "Maximal lock is seizure. Leave room to breathe."</p>
      </div>

      <p>I looked at the board. He had drawn a tiny tally of our claps and written a single word in small letters above it: close. He erased it with the back of a knuckle as if closing itself needed a closing. He can't help himself.</p>

      <p>"You keep telling me preference isn't structure," I said. "But what if I really prefer misfit. Like horror scores, like we said."</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Then you've trained your ear to like delayed closure," he said. "It's fine. Enjoy your haunted house. The lattice does not care about your outfit. Two-to-one will still be king when you take off your boots."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He turned both metronomes to the same tempo and lifted them onto a loose board balanced on two pencils. They found each other faster now, their small kicks persuading the board to sway, the board returning the favor. Order blooming out of pettiness.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Order parameter," he said, dry as a bone. "A single measure that tells you how the many are behaving. If you must be romantic, call it a shared mood." He tapped the board. "Be careful with shared moods."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He had me clap three against five one more time. This time I didn't fidget. I could feel the island at fifteen—far, but visible—and I held my line as if I'd booked a ticket.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Good," he said, ribbon withheld. "Phase budgeting. Keep a ledger of signed errors between layers. Correct where drift harms function. Preserve where drift gives texture. If you're not doing this on purpose, you're doing it by accident and lying about the bill."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He drew a rough wheel and marked seven spokes, then slipped an eighth between the first and the seventh like a pickpocket. "Scales are circles," he said. "The map you carry is wrong on purpose because straight lines are easier to draw. You live on loops. Every closure is a shoreline."</p>

      <p>I looked at the metronomes and felt a small gratitude I didn't want to admit.</p>

      <p>"Because they found each other?" he said. "Or because you didn't have to?"</p>

      <p>He knows where to press.</p>

      <p>He knocked the board so one metronome stumbled, then watched me watching them re-find their match. "This is the job," he said. "Ship sprints inside quarters; cadence resolves every LCM. Place your tension; don't pretend it isn't tension; close on schedule. If you break the schedule, pay in public."</p>

      <p>He tossed me a tin lid and a pencil. "Write me a pattern with one hand that closes at six and another that closes at ten," he said. "Keep both honest for a minute."</p>

      <p>I did not keep both honest for a minute.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"You'll get it," he said, as if reluctantly. "But stop praying to velocity. Speed isn't skill. Closure is."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He took the pencil from me with a touch that didn't feel like taking. "Last trick," he said. He set a slow pulse with his thumb on the table, then spoke a faster pattern against it, words riding the beat, meaning riding the words. He shifted where the stress landed and the sentence changed before it became a different sentence. It was the same sentence.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Cross-modulate yourself," he said. "Use a slow plan to shape a fast habit. Use a fast habit to decorate a slow plan. The whole of you is a polyrhythm. Learn to like the weave."</p>
      </div>

      <p>At the door, his hand found my shoulder for the length of one beat.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Stop smiling at math," he said. "Smile at closure."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He let go. I squared the chair, wiped the board, returned the metronomes to neutral ground. The tick in the corner resumed its civil insistence.</p>

      <p class="mt-8 italic text-gray-600">Later, trying to name the lesson, I failed and settled for a sequence: first the island, then the ocean, then the map that admits it's a loop—time making shapes when rhythms overlap, and me learning where to stand.</p>
