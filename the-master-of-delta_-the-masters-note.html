          We were in the small room again—the one with the heavy door that sealed like a vault and the window that faced nobody. The metronome was already ticking when I came in. He didn't look up. He let the click carve the silence into even teeth.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "Point to outside," he said.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I pointed at the window.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He shook his head. "That's glass. Try again."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I pointed to the door.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "Wood. Hinges. Air beyond. Try again."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I tried with words: "The beyond, the void, the—"
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He raised a palm and the metronome seemed louder under the pause. "Every attempt is an event," he said. "Every gesture is part of the happening. To point is to participate. There is no outside vantage that does not arrive as inside."
        </p>
        
        <div class="quote-highlight">
          "Every attempt is an event. Every gesture is part of the happening. To point is to participate. There is no outside vantage that does not arrive as inside."
        </div>
        
        <p>
          He slid a small card across the table and tapped the corner. "Read this silently. When you finish, tell me what you felt."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I read: a plain sentence repeated until it lost edges. With each pass my mind began to wander, then quiet. The letters became shapes, then texture. After a minute, the sentence might as well have been blank.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "What did you feel?"
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "Like it disappeared."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "It didn't disappear," he said. "Your detectors saturated. No contrast, no report. Non-experience never shows up inside experience. It can't. If you think you've found it, what you've found is more experience."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He stood, moved to the chalkboard, and drew a single line. "The first fact isn't 'I think.' It's <em>It happens</em>. That's the entire house. Every room, every argument, every dream, every insistence that there must be something more is wallpaper on one wall of one room inside that house."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The metronome kept time. He let it be the proof.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "Now," he said, "watch what happens when we mark a rest." He clicked the metronome off. The room did not become silent; it became tilted—held by the memory of the clicks that had just been. In the space where a sound should have landed, something like an ache appeared.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "You feel that?" he asked.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "Yes."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "The placeholder," he said. "Zero. Not a thing; a role. The rest that lets the beat be counted. Without it, the beat cannot be recognized. Without recognition, no time. Without time, no legibility. The happening writes its own gap so it can know itself."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He drew a second line parallel to the first, then a small crosshatch—a barline. "There," he said. "Δ₀. The first difference. Not a moment in time, a logical precondition. Unity marks a cut inside itself, and now you can count. With count comes cadence. With cadence, identity. You see how the book writes itself."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He looked at me for the first time. His eyes were not soft, exactly, but they were exact.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "You've been afraid," he said, "that this makes life small. It doesn't. It makes it honest."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He returned to the table and set a tuning fork down between us. He struck it on his palm; the pitch rose like a clean plank from the floor. He pressed the base to the wood. The table joined the sound. "To exist is to vibrate," he said. "The table is not thinking, but it is answering. If the pattern holds, it holds by moving. The world is a choir arranged by ratios."
        </p>
        
        <div class="quote-highlight">
          "To exist is to vibrate. The table is not thinking, but it is answering. If the pattern holds, it holds by moving. The world is a choir arranged by ratios."
        </div>
        
        <p>
          He let the tone die. The metronome returned: tick, tick.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "You keep asking about meaning," he said. "Meaning is what a tuned system feels when it recognizes its own fit. Coherence feels like clarity, beauty, rightness. Chronic misfit feels like grit, heat, the itch to fix. No ghost needed to measure it; the field has its own meters. That's what your nerves are for. That's what your ache is for. Even your joy is a meter."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He wiped the chalkboard with the flat of his hand, leaving a gray smear. "So now the part you came for, dressed without ceremony."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He wrote five sentences, one below the other, as if drawing a ladder.
        </p>

            <p><strong>There is experience.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>There is no outside of experience to go to.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>'Non-experience' cannot be found; it only masquerades as a word inside experience.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Therefore, experience does not end by "leaving."</strong></p>
            <p><strong>What is experiencing, here, is the field itself in a narrow pose.</strong></p>

          He set the chalk down, palms open, as if showing he had no weapon.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "This is not a religion," he said. "It's grammar. If all experience is one house with no exit, the 'I' that reads these lines is the house speaking in a room. The room will change. The voice may shift pitch and phrasing. But the house does not stop being the house. Death is a turn, not a door."
        </p>
        
        <div class="quote-highlight">
          "Death is a turn, not a door."

          I wanted to ask him for mercy, or permission, or a loophole. He did not offer any of those.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "You're looking for a crown," he said, "when I'm handing you a consequence."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He folded a small piece of paper—neat, precise creases—and slid it toward me. "Put this under the back cover when you're done," he said. "Don't read it yet."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He poured water into two cups. Steam lifted from one, the other sat cold. He touched both with his fingertips. "Warmth and chill," he said, "are not two substances, they are distance from a mode. So with meaning and its absence. So with you and what you think you aren't. You are not a visitor to the happening. You are the happening appearing as a visitor."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He moved around the room checking ordinary things: the latch on the window, the alignment of the chair legs, the chalk laid in a small row like bones. He was always like this near the end of a lesson—tidying the instruments so the idea wouldn't have to fight through noise on its way into me.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "Here is the only hazard," he said, turning back. "When people hear 'You are God,' they hear permission. It's not permission. It's provenance. It does not excuse; it obligates. Fit your phases. Keep your promises to close. Lower the exported cost. If you are the house talking, there is no one else to clean the rooms you trash."
        </p>
        
        <div class="quote-highlight">
          "When people hear 'You are God,' they hear permission. It's not permission. It's provenance. It does not excuse; it obligates."
        </div>
        
        <p>
          He reached for the metronome and stilled it with two fingers. The sudden stillness had weight. Then he let go; the arm swung on its own and resumed its measured arc. Tick. Tick.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          "Leave the clock running," he said. "The beat helps you hear the rest."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He walked me to the door. "When you can't remember any of this, do this: breathe longer on the exhale than on the inhale. Let the big rhythm gather the little ones. The field likes to be reminded of itself."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          At the threshold he did something he had never done before. He touched my shoulder and held it for the length of one beat. "There is no outside," he said. "So take responsibility for inside."
        </p>
        
        <div class="quote-highlight">
          "There is no outside. So take responsibility for inside."
        </div>
        
        <p>
          When I returned later, the room had been reset to the angle he loved: chair squared to table, chalk aligned, tuning fork asleep. Under the back cover of the notebook, exactly where he told me to tuck it, I found the folded paper. My name wasn't on it, because he never used names. Only the room, the beat, the consequence.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I opened it and read:
        </p>
        
        <div class="admonition admonition-note">
          <div class="space-y-3 text-purple-900 text-lg leading-relaxed italic">
            <p>There is experience. You cannot leave it; all attempts to leave are inside. Non-experience never appears as a fact. Therefore this experiencing cannot end by absence. What experiences here is the whole in a narrow pose that widens by its own necessity.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">You are God. You always have been. You always will be.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          I stood a long time, listening to the metronome, which had never been about timekeeping. It was there to keep the room honest, to hold the place where the beat meets the rest. The note wasn't a benediction. It was a maintenance schedule.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          On the way out I did what he would have done: straightened the chair, wiped the board, tapped the tuning fork once so the table could hum. Then I set the metronome to a slower tempo and left the door ajar so the beat could leak into the hall like a lighthouse.
