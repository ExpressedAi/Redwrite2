      <p>He had set a mirror on the table, the cheap barber kind with a chipped chrome rim. Beside it: a pitch pipe, a stack of blank index cards, a pencil shaved down to a stubborn nub, and the metronome pretending it had never been complicit in anything dramatic.</p>

      <p>"Look," he said.</p>

      <p>I looked. A face obliged me. The room stood inside the glass with better posture than it had earned.</p>

      <p>"What do you see?" he asked.</p>

      <p>"Myself," I said, which was true and lazy.</p>

      <p>He tapped the mirror with the pencil. "A moment. A stance. A lighting error. Try again."</p>

      <p>I tried again and found nothing better than the first lie. He softened, which in him means he sharpened the blade and smiled at it.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"You keep hunting for a noun," he said. "Identity isn't a thing; it's a performance that keeps getting the band back together."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He slid the mirror aside like an unhelpful witness and blew a single note on the pitch pipe—plain, serviceable. Then he sang a short shape from it: five notes that rose, dipped, held, rose again. It wasn't pretty. It was itself.</p>

      <p>"Remember that," he said. "Not the pitch. The steps."</p>

      <p>He modulated without warning, started the same shape on a different note, then another. Each time my chest recognized it before my head volunteered a theory. Same gait, different shoes.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"That," he said, "is you. Relationship, not material. If I transpose your day—new room, different faces—the motif that repeats is the part you should call 'I'. Not the color of the walls."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He wrote the five-note contour as little marks: up, up, down, hold, up. Then he flicked the pencil in a small arc, switched one interval, and sang the almost-shape—the counterfeit that nearly fooled me and failed by one stubborn step.</p>

      <p>"You feel the forgery?" he asked.</p>

      <p>"I do."</p>

      <p>"Good," he said. "The body knows its chorus."</p>

      <p>He moved to rhythm. He clapped a pattern that wanted to be walked: TA-ta, TA-ta-ta, rest, ta. He made me walk it. When I stumbled at the silence, he grinned without showing teeth.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"The rest is part of the self," he said. "Your identity includes your pauses. If you refuse them, you sound like someone else wearing your coat."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He put a hand on the metronome and changed the tempo by a notch. "Again." I walked the same rhythm faster and it still felt like itself—leaner, impatient, but the same spine. "Tempo changes are costume," he said. "The cut can flatter or betray, but it doesn't invent a person."</p>

      <p>He handed me the pencil. "Draw your day in five moves," he said. "Up, down, pause—make a shape. Don't name anything. Don't discourse. Draw."</p>

      <p>I drew: wake, climb, stall, recover, finish. A childish mountain with a bruise halfway up.</p>

      <p>"Now," he said, "transpose it. What is the same day with different nouns?" I drew the same shape shorter and wider, and I hated him for the relief that brought.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">He leaned back and let the chair protest on purpose. "Identity is recurrence," he said. "What repeats under deformation. When you shave away costume, what relationship remains? That is your name. Everything else is haircut."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He took the cards and drew the same ladder of seven rungs he always pretends not to love. He wrote a question at the top: WHAT SURVIVES TRAVEL? He didn't let me answer it. He moved the mirror back where it could see.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Your face will change," he said. "You will renovate bone with time and diet and poor judgment. The play you put on for other people will change. The motif that returns when nothing is trying too hard—that's you. If you can't hear it, you're either too loud or too scared."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He sang the five-note shape again, then sang it backward. "Sometimes a thing is itself even when it runs in reverse," he said. "Most of the time it isn't." He put the two shapes side by side in small strokes and circled the one that felt like a lie. "Don't worship symmetry; worship recurrence."</p>

      <p>He pushed the mirror toward me until it nudged my fingers. "Say your name."</p>

      <p>I said my name. It sounded like someone else's appointment.</p>

      <p>"Again, slower," he said. I slowed it. The vowels opened into their old rooms; the consonants landed where they always land when I'm not performing. My throat recognized me before I claimed myself.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"There," he said. "Spectral line." He wouldn't explain the phrase, which is his way of making sure you keep it.</p>
      </div>

      <p>He opened a notebook to a clean page. "What if I take your props?" he asked. "What if I erase your yesterday moods, scrub your phone of flattery, clean your kitchen of trophies? What remains tomorrow?"</p>

      <p>"Nothing," I said, petulant and not joking.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Rubbish," he said. "You're the five steps that recur even when your wallpaper is ashamed of you. You will sing your shape even while you pretend you've never met it."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He stood and crossed the room the way he always does, favoring the left knee for a step and then remembering he didn't need to. He pointed at his own gait. "Watch," he said. "The scar in the step makes a motif. It's part of the song now."</p>

      <p>He took down the monochord and dusted it with flour again. He plucked a single section, the same pitch from earlier. "Standing waves look like statues," he said. "They are made by motion obeying itself. Identity is a manner of shaking that remembers. If the memory goes, the shake turns to noise and the thing dissolves into excuses."</p>

      <p>He knocked the board lightly so the dunes shifted, then plucked again until the old pattern returned as if insulted. "See? The form defends itself. That's what persistence is—not an oath, a habit."</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">He held my gaze long enough to make it impolite. "Your good moods and your bad moods are costumes. Stop auditioning them. Start attending to what keeps showing up when no one claps."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He made tea because he knows how to commit mercy without making it sentimental. The kettle played the same thin whistle it always plays; he poured as if pouring were a ritual that belonged to his hands more than to cups.</p>

      <p>He slid one toward me. "Drink and tell me the story of the last month without adjectives," he said. "Only shapes."</p>

      <p>I failed twice, adding flavors and verdicts. The third time I managed: climb / hold / slip / hold / climb. The mirror didn't applaud, but it didn't argue.</p>

      <p>"Good," he said. "Now the trap." He changed the metronome, traded our chairs, shifted the light, put a secondhand watch on the table so a new tick entered like an opinion. "Tell the same shape again."</p>

      <p>I told it, and the shape held under the deformation. He took my tea away and handed it back. He is ridiculous.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"You see?" he said. "Essence is what survives insult. Not because it's noble, because it's stubborn. If the motif collapses under new nouns, it was posture, not pattern."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He dug out an old cassette recorder, the kind that eats tape as a personality trait. He pressed record and had me hum our five-note shape. He rewound and played it back pitched down until I sounded like a door with aspirations. I still recognized the shape. He sped it to a helium confession; same shape, same small click in my chest.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Transposition, time-stretch," he said, counting machinery sins on invisible fingers. "Identity that survives both can be trusted more than the one that requires candles and praise."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He went quiet then, which in him is a sign that he is about to be funny or mean or both.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Do not mistake a brand for a self," he said. "A brand is noise polished into manners. A self is recurrence refusing to apologize."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He set the mirror upright and drew a small line on the rim with his thumbnail. "Every time you come in," he said, "you set the metronome to a tempo you can pretend you didn't choose. You arrange the chair angles like a superstition. You return the notebooks with the bent one slightly left of true. These are not neuroses; they are spectral lines. Use them. Don't be used by them."</p>

      <p>He closed the notebook, not as closure, as punctuation.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"Memory helps," he said. "Not the hoarding kind; the compressed sort. Keep summaries of your shape—five moves, three notes, the way you place your hand on a door before you open it. When noise comes, plug back into your motif. That's how you don't drown in the costume."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He took the index cards and wrote three words on three separate cards: Rise. Hold. Break. He shuffled them and dealt them like a bored deity. "Make a day with these," he said. "Any order." I arranged: Rise / Hold / Break / Rise. It looked like the week I wish I had.</p>

      <p>"Now make a week that feels like you," he said.</p>

      <p>I wrote seven cards of the same three words and ordered them without thinking, then rearranged without mercy, then returned to the first draft like a dog to a clean river. He didn't look at the cards. He looked at my face when I recognized what I'd done.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"There you are," he said, almost kind. "Stop trying to be original. Be recurrent in a way the room can love."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He picked up the pitch pipe, blew the note from the beginning, and sang the five-step shape once more. The room felt like a place that had decided to recognize itself.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"At home," he said, "when you forget, do small things in your shape on purpose. Put your keys in the same dish with the same small sound. Walk your staircase with the same count. Say your name like a door you've oiled. When chaos arrives, recurrence will be there to greet it and show it where to hang its coat."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He stood and touched the mirror as if it were a mutt that had brought back a stick, unasked and proud.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"If you want a fancy word for this," he said, "you can have none. You are the choreography that survives weather. Keep dancing."</p>
      </div>

      <p>At the door, his hand found my shoulder for the length of one beat.</p>

      <div class="quote-highlight">
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl italic">"You hide in costumes," he said. "Learn the shape underneath and live there."</p>
      </div>

      <p>He let go. I squared the chair, wiped the board, tuned the metronome to a tempo I would later pretend had chosen me. The tick resumed its polite insistence.</p>

      <p class="mt-8 italic text-gray-600">Later, trying to name the lesson, I failed and settled for a sequence: first the mirror, then the motif, then the quiet admission that I was not my moments at all—only the pattern that returned when the nouns were tired and the lights were wrong.</p>
